To run the program, use a console/terminal, NOT Visual Studio/Rider. This is because the program needs to be run with parameters:

Wallet.exe <account_name>. For example:

```.\Wallet.exe Alex```

If no account is present on computer locally, a new one will be created with a specified name, age, and description.

Here is how the main menu looks in the program:

Editing and showing account information:

Adding and removing money from balance:

Actions with categories:

Now, this is the place where we are in another view: Category. Each category has its separate view with a couple of actions we can do. For example, add and remove invoices:

We can edit category info as well, and then go back to the main view:

Now, there is the category when we try to list them all:

Finally, we can exit the application:

Now this is an interesting point. If we try to log back in, all the data will be restored. All the information will be back. No registration will be needed:
